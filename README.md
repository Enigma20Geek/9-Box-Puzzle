# 9-Box-Puzzle
This is the Java implementation of 9 Box Sliding Puzzle.

This was the first Java Project I made. So I thought that I should make it complete with dialogue boxes, highscore, audio and animations.
At that time I didn't knew much about Java Swing Library and Multithreading. So this project turned out to be very helpful for me to understand these concepts.
There are some problems though, like audio lags a little for the first move but then works fine and the game is fully functional for 4x4 puzzle except the fact that the text on the gui overlaps with the tiles.

Hope you like it!
